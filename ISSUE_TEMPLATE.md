Thank you for wanting to take the time to report an issue. 

As far as I am concerned, LOC-Extension is "functionally stabilised"; it does what it was intended to do and I don't have the time or inclination to improve or extend it. 

The most frequent request is for new tickers, exchanges or aggregator sources. The extension is built on a snapshot of https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt, which doubtless now handles more exchanges and coins than the embedded version. Anyone is free to fork the repository and refresh the snapshot. There have been a number of forks of the repository but when I last checked (27/4/2021) none of them had made any updates.
